Various functions that might be useful again.
A lot of these have strange functionality built into them to suit the application they originally came from.
All of the files are written in and for Python 3.
Numpy and Pandas are used in almost all files.

* Data_Collator - a drive cycle generator that creates a requested number of random drive cycls of a set length.
* Time_2_Distance - converts from the time domain to the distance domain with oversampling if required
* Windowing - Holds the logic for windows with a set overlap and width
* Permute.cs - C# permutation calculator as this cannot be done using a module as in Python. The input at current is a string but this could be manipulated easily.
